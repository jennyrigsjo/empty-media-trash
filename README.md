Customize the frequency with which the media library trash is emptied.

== Description ==

By default, media (such as images) and other post types (such as posts and pages) are permanently removed from the WordPress trash after a period of 30 days. Some may wish to permanently delete trashed media files more frequently than that. This plugin lets you change the interval of permanent removal for *items in the media trash*, without affecting the permanent removal frequency of other post types.

== Installation ==

**DISCLAIMER: The plugin is not yet listed in the official WordPress directory. Do not install directly on a production site, always test new plugins on a development site first.**

1. Unzip the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin area.
3. Go to Settings->Media and customize the file removal frequency for the media trash.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the removal frequency be set to longer than 30 days/4 weeks? =
